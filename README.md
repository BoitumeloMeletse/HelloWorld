# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}



{Provide a description of your software}
As a software engineer, I am continuously improving my ability to work with different programming languages and development tools. This project helps strengthen my understanding of compiling, running, and managing Java programs while practicing good documentation and version control habits.
This software is a simple Java console application that prints a greeting message and a personalized message to the screen.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The purpose of creating this software is to verify that my development environment is correctly configured, practice writing and compiling Java code, and demonstrate my ability to publish a working project using GitHub.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
